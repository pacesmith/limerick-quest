near which a portentous endeavor
began with a crime
and ends with a climb -
or death, if you&#39;re not very clever.

$more[There once was a crook called $m[Mulana],
as dangerous as belladonna,
whose mastermind eyes
had tagged a grand prize:
a Fabergé egg - crime nirvana.

$more[There once was a cat burglar, $v[Verge],
the grappling-hooked egg-stealing scourge
of King Oaks Casino.
A stealthy neutrino,
she lifted the egg, then emerged.

$more[The egg, upon further description,
contained a small Russian inscription.
The two hopped a boat,
went east, bought a coat,
and now it is time for decryption.

Клад похоронено навеки

Я открою дверь

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Go to the east of the river,
The treasure is buried forever.
Dig in the square,
I will open the door,
revealing the Aztec enigma.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

$more[To seek out the square is the way;
you scrutinize all you survey.
You brandish your whip
and your shovel&#39;s steel tip.

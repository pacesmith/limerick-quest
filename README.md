Limerick Quest (Twine game, Harlowe 3.1.0)

4th place at IFComp 2020 (http://ifcomp.org/comp/2020/)

Some hacks, some workarounds, some useful tricks, and some clever bits - like the INV passage, which ensures that your inventory is a proper limerick (or two) no matter which items you're carrying, and the minecart sequence, which fills in letters of words one by one with an optional timer.

If you saw anything in Limerick Quest that you'd like to use in your own work, feel free! If you use any of the limericks, though, please credit me, Pace Smith.
